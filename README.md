# DMFFSD: A forest fire smoke dataset based on diffusion model
Forest fires are among the most destructive natural disasters globally, with their frequency and intensity increasing due to climate change and human activities, posing severe threats to ecosystems and human society. In response to the need for early detection and warning of wildfires, drones have emerged as a key tool due to their flexibility and real-time capabilities. However, existing drone-based forest fire smoke datasets generally suffer from issues such as data scarcity, limited diversity in scenarios, and inconsistent quality, which restrict the performance and generalization capability of detection models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a diffusion-model-based framework for generating a forest fire smoke dataset, named DMFFSD. This dataset is constructed using a pre-trained diffusion model combined with a text-guided generation method, producing 7,780 high-resolution images and including 14,948 manually annotated bounding boxes. The dataset encompasses three seasons (summer, autumn, and winter) and various weather conditions (e.g., sunny and sunset), while also covering diverse terrains, fire intensities, and smoke patterns, thereby enhancing the model's generalization capability in complex scenarios.
