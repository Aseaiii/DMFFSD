# DMFFSD: A diverse forest fire smoke dataset generated based on a pre-trained diffusion model
A forest fire dataset containing 7,780 images was generated using a diffusion model. The dataset encompasses diverse scenarios, various smoke patterns, different fire intensities, and images captured at different times, offering rich diversity and representativeness.


We provide Python code for converting different tags in our repository, including code for converting from YOLO tag format to VOC tag format and from VOC tag format to COCO tag format, making it convenient for researchers to use in various frameworks. We have clearly provided the access address in the paper to ensure the reproducibility and verifiability of the work.
